1) What is the definition of server port?
The answer is: Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client. These ports are assigned a unique number to identify them separately. Port 80 and 443 are the two standard ports used by web servers to communicate with the web clients.

2) What is server port range?
The answer is: Port numbers are divided into ranges as follows:

Port numbers 0-1023 – Well known ports. These are allocated to server services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). e.g Web servers normally use port 80 and SMTP servers use port 25.

Ports 1024-49151- Registered Port -These can be registered for services with the IANA and should be treated as semi-reserved. User written programs should not use these ports.

Ports 49152-65535– These are used by client programs and you are free to use these in client programs. When a Web browser connects to a web server the browser will allocate itself a port in this range. Also known as ephemeral ports.

3) How many bits does number above represent?
The answer is: A port number uses 16 bits and so can therefore have a value from 0 to 65535 decimal

4) State 10 common server ports
The answer is: The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned port numbers to commonly used services like SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and others. Here are some of the most common ones:

Port Number	Usage

20		File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer
21		File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control
22		Secure Shell (SSH)
23		Telnet - Remote login service, unencrypted text messages
25		Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) E-mail Routing
53		Domain Name System (DNS) service
80		Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in World Wide Web
110		Post Office Protocol (POP3) used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a server
119		Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
123		Network Time Protocol (NTP)
143		Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Management of Digital Mail
161		Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
194		Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
443		HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL
